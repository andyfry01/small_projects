# Cleverbot Chat App

This is one of the ideas I had for a project I had at General Assembly but never got around to actually building. The whole idea is to have multiple instances of a Cleverbot asking and answering each other's questions, with the user picking which answers are fed back into the primary "conversation partner"; a kind of robot Turing test with a human moderator.

One Cleverbot instance acts as the primary conversation partner, and it kicks off the conversation. The user asks the primary conversation partner a question, it gives a response, and that response is fed in turn to three other Cleverbot instances, who then generate their own responses. The user picks one of these responses, which is fed back into the primary conversation partner bot, who delivers a response, so on and so forth.
