# Frogger

## A simple JS Frogger game

After watching this coding challenge video series by Daniel Shiffman ([Video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giXV6xErw0Y), [Github repo here](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Code/tree/master/CodingChallenges/CC_73_Frogger)), I wanted to try my own hand at building my own version.

I may go back and reference the demonstration code from the video every once in a while, but I want to try to do as much from scratch as I can now that I've got an idea of the foundation and concepts.
