# Time tracker app

This is a simple time tracker to use during my job search. So the saying goes: "Things that are measured are things that are managed." It basically consists of:   

  - Buttons which are divided up into categories depending on different activities over the day
  - Timers attached to the buttons which keep track of elapsed time when clicked.
  - Clicking any given button will start a timer, and clicking on the same button will cancel the timer and add the elapsed time to a running total. Clicking on another button/category performs the same function, but also starts a new timer on that category for further tracking.

## Possible and/or planned iterations, features:

  - Simple backend to keep track of time metrics over multiple days and weeks
  - Visualizations of time categories, comparisons
  - Customizable CMS interface (i.e. no static categories)
