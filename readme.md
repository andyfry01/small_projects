# TD Ameritrade Followup
This is a followup to an interview held at TD Ameritrade for a developer role.

It consists of two implementations of questions asked during the coding portion of the interview.

The idea is to represent two boxes on the page, one within the other, with the inner (child) box having equidistant spacing on all sides to the outer (parent) box. One implementation uses the margin attribute on the child box to achieve this, the second implementation uses flexbox.

There are also inputs for resizing the parent and child boxes to demonstrate that the centering works for any arbitrary box sizes.

1) `git clone https://github.com/andyfry01/TDA_thankyou`
